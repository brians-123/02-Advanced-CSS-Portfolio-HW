Creating a portfolio to display my work

## Description 
``
This is homework for the second week of the UW/Trilogy coding bootcamp. In summary, this assignment will be to create the framework for a portfolio of my best work throughout the course. For this assignment, I will attempt to match an image of an example site without any source code.
I created placeholders for all links other than references to targets on the page.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Original
```
This is the base site I'm trying to build towards in the first revision. I plan
on using something similar, so I will likely turn this into a real project by
the end of class and it will not look quite like the gif.
